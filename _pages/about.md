I am currently a second-year master's student at Anhui Polytechnic University, under the supervision of <a href="#">Subin Huang</a>.

My research centers on **Efficient AI**, **Multimodal AI**, and **Generative AI**, with a particular focus on **pruning Large Language Models (LLMs) for performance optimization.**

I am honored to serve as a remote research assistant for <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AK9VF30AAAAJ&hl">Linfeng Zhang</a>, where I contribute to projects on **Efficient AI**.

I previously completed a high-definition map (HDMap) engineering internship at <a href="https://en.megvii.com/megvii_research">Megvii Research</a>'s Transformer Group for over `900` days, where I honed my collaboration and engineering skills.

Earlier, I completed a remote research internship with <a href="https://lichao-sun.github.io/">Lichao Sun</a>, whose guidance has been immensely helpful, and I am deeply grateful for his support.

🌱 I am fully dedicated to advancing my research in these areas, working tirelessly toward my passion 🏃‍♂️.

Collaborative opportunities are always welcome—please feel free to reach out.
