I am a second-year master's student at Anhui Polytechnic University, advised by Professor <a href="#">Subin Huang</a>.

My research focuses on Efficient AI, Multimodal AI, and Generative AI, with current work on pruning Large Language Models (LLMs) for optimization.

I welcome opportunities to collaborate on impactful AI projectsâ€”feel free to get in touch.
