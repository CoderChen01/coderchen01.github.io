I am currently a second-year master's student at Anhui Polytechnic University, under the supervision of <a href="#">Subin Huang</a>.

My research centers on **Efficient AI**, **Multimodal AI**, and **Generative AI**, with a particular focus on **pruning Large Language Models (LLMs) for performance optimization.**

I am honored to serve as a remote research assistant for <a href="http://www.zhanglinfeng.tech/">Linfeng Zhang</a>, where I contribute to projects on **Efficient AI**.

Previously, I completed a remote research internship with <a href="https://lichao-sun.github.io/">Lichao Sun</a>, whose guidance has been immensely helpful, and I am deeply grateful for his support.

I am fully dedicated to advancing my research in these areas, working tirelessly toward my passion🏃‍♂️.

Collaborative opportunities are always welcome—please feel free to reach out.
